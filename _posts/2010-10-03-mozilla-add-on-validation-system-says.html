<p>
Configuration Mania 1.12.2010091201 could not pass Mozilla Add-ons' review. Reviewer says HTTP Network settings are unsafe. On <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/pages/validation#help-22">Mozilla Add-ons' validation description page</a>, they say:
</p>
<blockquote cite="https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/pages/validation#help-22">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li>network.http.*</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td> Changing network preferences can cause subtle browsing bugs as well as problems with certain servers and ISPs. This is generally not allowed.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the next release of Configuration Mania, I will either
</p>
<ul>
<li>remove <strong>all</strong> network setting so as to pass the review; or</li>
<li>give up to pass the review and Configuration Mania have not been reviewed.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Which way am I going?
