It works with Firefox(Gecko) and Safari(WebKit). (does not work with Google Chrome.)

This web app demo generates 16-bit-linear-PCM WAV file dynamically, and plays it with HTML 5 &lt;audio&gt; elements. It isn't required any plugin. All procedures such as generating WAV files are written in JavaScript.
