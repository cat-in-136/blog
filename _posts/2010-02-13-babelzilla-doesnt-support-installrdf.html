<p>
Babelzilla doesn't support "install.rdf" localization.
</p>

<p>
Babel wiki show <a href="http://babelwiki.babelzilla.org/index.php?title=Tutorials#How_to_localize_the_initial_description_of_an_extension">how to localize the initial description of an extension</a> in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Localizing_extension_descriptions#Localizing_before_Gecko_1.9">older way</a>.
</p>
<blockquote cite="http://babelwiki.babelzilla.org/index.php?title=Tutorials">
IMPORTANT NOTE: this tutorial is still valid but there is another way of localizing metadata in the install.rdf since Gecko 1.9 . Please read this article

<p>
The older way is still valid,
but I seem to have to transcribe metadata from the older localization properties files (which are downloaded from babelzilla) to install.rdf.
